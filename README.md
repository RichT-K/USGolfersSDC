# USGolfersSDC
Project encapsulating the three main segments of the USGolfers Application - Server-API-Client

    Server : ASP( JScript and Classic) routing requests to/from Clients while providing data from the API
    
    API    : ASP( JScript and Classic) database interface
    
    Client : Svelte components, some with offline capabilities

ASP has been a dying language for a decade or more an yet it is still around and still performs adaquately.
It and Svelte have been chosen for comfort and simplicity of development since much of the work has been performed
previously in one or more prototypes. At any time during development any or all of the architectures may be changed to improve performance or security.

Each segment will be privately collaborated sub projects. 

As my strength in git is growing I'll start simply by creating each of the segment Projects with minimal code to support a basic implementation of the web site.
Hopefully, with help I'll see rapid progress while maintain a stable prodcut. If not, it easy to start again.

Thank you,
Rich
